				Help for the User Menu
		
User Manager:

     This is TUI which had it's ideas from SCO's SCOadmin.  
     This will feature a user list which is  still being worked on 
     as, C programming is a not so new to me and still learning it. 
     I tend to do it as a hobby in spare time.
     
     However SCO admin on UNIX is an interpreted lanagauge that uses /usr/bin/osavtcl 
     to draw out the TUI.
     Where this is more written in C, so therefore contains no UNIX code.
     
     
     This type of stuff did start with shell scripting and attempted to 
     write it in python, then went to C.

Help - This Screen

Quit - Depends how it is ran, if ran from command prompt as an argument then
 back to the command prompt. If accessed from main menu then back to the main menu.

F10 Key does it too.
