				Help for the User Manager
				
This is a SCO Admin like interface. As that is where the idea did 
orignially came from to create this system as well as some parts 
from SMIT.

The user list table  - Not yet complete as I need to find a way to
 scroll up/down on this as well as be able to select usernames.
 
F4. Add user, goes to Add User Dialog
F5. Remove User
F6. Modify User



The other controls are pretty much the same.
