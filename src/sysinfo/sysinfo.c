 * sysinfo.c - System Info program which has been used on many occassions while learning C
 * was decided to be included in to SMIT. However the whole program is entirely put in curses by myself
 * while some code came from either a book. The Code that contains uptime came from another user called YMRT when
 * a friend required help with C. This program was previously written as a console app without ncurses.
