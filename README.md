# FreeBSD-SMIT-0.1-Alpha
System Management Tool for FreeBSD (AIX SMIT Clone) written in C

Project Description:

This is an AIX SMIT like program for FreeBSD type systems. It is mainly a front end to FreeBSD commands for
the console.

Ideas of writing such program started as a hobbyist who had a GNU/Linux based distro called Ezarch which 
later was no longer maintained due to the use of BSD.

However SMIT was going to be written for Linux distro and was in python using ncurses. Then I started to do more
with FreeBSD and stayed on FreeBSD world. I decided to stick with FreeBSD OS although I have no FreeBSD distros yet. 
Personally I don't have a lot of time to keep maintaining a Linux distribution.

In the End this program was written in C and on FreeBSD using ncurses because there was a lot I liked about C compared 
python.

This program was written only in my free time. So certain areas are added to quite slowly. Kernel manager is capabe 
instructing the system to compile the kerenl and install it.

However this was learned from several books on programming.
